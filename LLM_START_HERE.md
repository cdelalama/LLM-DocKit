# LLM Start Guide - <PROJECT_NAME>

## Read This First (Mandatory)

Welcome to <PROJECT_NAME>. Before you contribute, review and adapt the sections below to match the project requirements. Replace angle-bracket placeholders (<...>) with real values and share this file with every LLM agent.

Recommended reading order:
1. This file (rules, workflows, and current expectations)
2. docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (vision, architecture, current state)
3. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (optional: architecture, contracts, roadmap)
4. docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md (version management policy)
5. docs/llm/README.md (LLM docs index)
6. docs/llm/HANDOFF.md (current work state and priorities)
7. docs/llm/DECISIONS.md (stable rationale; link from HANDOFF)

## Critical Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Language Policy
- All code and documentation: English (update if your project needs a different language)
- Conversation with the user: <CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE>
- Comments in code: English
- File names: English

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START doc-update-rules -->
### Documentation Update Rules
- Update docs/llm/HANDOFF.md every time you make a change.
- Append an entry to docs/llm/HISTORY.md in every session.
- HISTORY format: YYYY-MM-DD - <LLM_NAME> - <Brief summary> - Files: [list] - Version impact: [yes/no + details]
- Put long-form rationale in docs/llm/DECISIONS.md and link to it from HANDOFF.
- Prefer ASCII-only in docs/llm/* to avoid Windows encoding issues.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END doc-update-rules -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START doc-sync-rules -->
### Documentation Sync Rules
- Keep this file's "Current Focus" section synchronized with docs/llm/HANDOFF.md "Current Status".
- Keep docs/STRUCTURE.md synchronized with the actual repository file tree.
- Keep docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md synchronized with architectural reality.
- Version markers (`<!-- doc-version: X.Y.Z -->`) in documentation files are managed by `scripts/bump-version.sh`. See `docs/version-sync-manifest.yml` for the full list of tracked files.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END doc-sync-rules -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START commit-policy -->
### Commit Message Policy
- Every response that includes code or documentation changes must end with suggested commit information:
  - **Title:** under 72 characters
  - **Description:** under 200 characters, focused on user impact and why the change matters
- Format:
  `
  ## Commit Info
  **Title:** <concise title>
  **Description:** <short explanation of what changed and why>
  `
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END commit-policy -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START version-management -->
### Version Management
- Every commit that changes code/config files MUST include a version bump. The pre-commit hook enforces this.
- For version bumps, run `scripts/bump-version.sh <new_version>`; do not edit version strings manually.
- The bump script reads `docs/version-sync-manifest.yml` to update all tracked files atomically.
- Validate sync with `scripts/check-version-sync.sh` (also available as pre-commit hook).
- Do not bump versions without consulting docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md for impact level (patch/minor/major).
- Do NOT batch multiple code commits without versioning. No exceptions.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END version-management -->

<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:START env-policy -->
### Environment Files (If Applicable)
- Do not edit generated .env.example files directly.
- Never change or remove existing credentials in .env or equivalent secret stores.
- If a new variable is needed, document it in the relevant README and ask the user to add it manually.
<!-- DOCKIT-TEMPLATE:END env-policy -->

## Current Focus (Snapshot)

Source of truth: docs/llm/HANDOFF.md.
- Last Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD - Author>
- Working on: <Feature or task>
- Status: <Short status summary>

Keep this section synchronized with the "Current Status" block in docs/llm/HANDOFF.md.

## LLM-to-LLM Communication
When handing off to another LLM:
1. Update docs/llm/HANDOFF.md with the current state and next steps.
2. Append an entry to docs/llm/HISTORY.md following the required format.
3. Ensure the snapshot in this file matches the latest status.
