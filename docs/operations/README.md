# Operations Runbooks

Use this folder to store operational procedures, drills, and incident response guides. Each runbook should be self-contained and reference related automation or scripts when relevant.

## Index

- `docs/operations/README.md` - This index and runbook conventions.
- `docs/operations/API_CONTRACT.md` (optional) - How to prevent API/spec/client drift.
- `docs/operations/DEPLOY_PLAYBOOK.md` (optional) - Deployment + rollback checklist.

Suggested sections for each runbook:
1. Purpose and scope
2. Prerequisites and required access
3. Step-by-step procedure
4. Validation / rollback steps
5. Contact or escalation information

Create new documents in this directory as your operational footprint grows.
